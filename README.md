# Covid19-fake-news-detector
Replicating a research project on COVID-19 fake news detection by Patwa, Sharma, Pykl, Guptha, Kumari, Akhtar,  Ekbal, Das, and Chakraborty(2020), we create experiments with changing the four models default parameters to create another four models with better performance. Lastly, we have found an unseen dataset from Kaggle created by Banik(2020) to test both original models and modified ones.

# Dataset
The original dataset used in the project is located in the original_data folder. Additionally, a new dataset named new_data.csv is required for testing the models on unseen data that was created by Banik(2020).

# Replication
1. Do git clone
2. cd to the Repository
3. Open the ipynb files on Jupyter Notebooks
4. Execute the cells
